        <h1>About Gohar Mahal </h1>
        <p>Bhimbetka Rock Shelter is the oldest known rock art in India. It is one of the largest prehistoric complexes
            to be seen located at the foothills of the Vindhya Mountains on the southern edge of the Central Indian
            Plateau. It largely displays paintings of human life that date from the Mesolithic period to the historical
            period.
            <br>
            The themes and motifs depicted in these paintings, such as hunting, dance, animals, geometric figures, etc.,
            provide insight into the cultural development of human beings. The colors used for the paintings are
            vegetable colors.
